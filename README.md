# **Lens Profile Generator**

**Version**: 1.0  
**Author**: [Your Name]  
**Platform**: LabVIEW

## **Overview**

The **Lens Profile Generator** is a LabVIEW-based application designed to create a lens profile by generating a set of (r, z) points. Users can input specific lens parameters such as radius, curvature, and thickness to generate a graphical representation of the lens profile and export the data for further analysis.

This software supports spherical and aspherical lens designs and includes options to visualize the profile and export it as a CSV file.

---

## **Features**

- **Input Parameters**:  
  Users can provide the following parameters:
  - Radius of the lens (r)
  - Curvature of the lens (R)
  - Thickness at the center
  - Optional: Aspheric coefficients \(A_4, A_6, A_8\) for more advanced designs
  - Optional: Refractive index and material type for future enhancements

- **Profile Generation**:  
  Generates the (r, z) points for the lens profile based on mathematical models for spherical and aspherical lenses.

- **Graphical Visualization**:  
  Displays the generated lens profile on an XY graph in real time.

- **Data Export**:  
  Ability to export the lens profile points (r, z) as a CSV file or text file for external use.

- **Clear and Reset**:  
  Reset the input fields and clear the graph with a simple button click.

---

## **System Requirements**

- **LabVIEW Version**: LabVIEW 2020 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows 7/8/10 or macOS
- **RAM**: 4 GB (minimum)
- **Disk Space**: 100 MB (minimum)

## **Installation**

1. **Download the Software**:  
   Download the LabVIEW project files from the repository or provided location.

2. **Open in LabVIEW**:  
   Open the `.lvproj` file using LabVIEW.

3. **Run the Application**:  
   On the front panel, click the "Run" button to start the software.

---

## **Usage**

1. **Input Parameters**:  
   - Enter the radius, curvature, thickness, and optional aspheric coefficients into the provided fields on the front panel.
   - Adjust values as needed for your lens design.

2. **Generate Profile**:  
   - Click the **Generate** button to calculate and display the lens profile.
   - The profile will appear in the XY graph as a series of (r, z) points.

3. **Save Profile**:  
   - Click the **Save Profile** button to export the profile data.
   - The exported file will be saved as a CSV or text file containing the (r, z) points.

4. **Clear and Reset**:  
   - Click the **Clear** button to reset all inputs and clear the graph for a new calculation.

## **Mathematical Models**

The software uses two key mathematical models for lens profile generation:

1. **Spherical Lenses**:  
   The lens surface is generated using the formula:  
   \[
   z = \frac{r^2}{R}
   \]
   where \(R\) is the radius of curvature, and \(r\) is the radial distance.

2. **Aspherical Lenses**:  
   More advanced lens profiles are generated using:  
   \[
   z = \frac{r^2}{R} + A_4 r^4 + A_6 r^6 + A_8 r^8
   \]
   where \(A_4, A_6, A_8\) are the aspheric coefficients.

---

## **Error Handling**

- The software validates user inputs to ensure correct values for radius, curvature, and other parameters.
- Error messages are displayed for invalid inputs, such as negative values or missing coefficients.

---

## **Known Issues**

- Performance may slow down with extremely large input values or very high-density profiles.
- Aspheric coefficients need to be carefully chosen to avoid generating nonsensical profiles.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

- Support for additional lens types (e.g., biconvex, biconcave).
- Integration of material properties such as refractive index.
- 3D visualization of the lens profile.
- User-defined custom lens profiles.
